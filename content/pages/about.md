Hi, I am Tarun Karamchandani and I am currently working as as Tech Lead at a company called Instawork. I have mostly worked on Django, Flask, AWS, Docker, Microservices, React and Android. Apart from writing code I enjoy reading books and playing online/board games.

I started writing this blog to share my experiences and help people avoid roadblocks or mistakes that I have faced. Hope it helps.
