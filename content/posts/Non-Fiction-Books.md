If you know me, you already know that I love reading non fiction books. Specially the ones which make you wonder and think about different topics, and make you see the world and it's reality with a new perspective. Below are my top 7 favourite non fiction books of all time. I hope you find something worth your time.

## 1. [Sapiens](https://amzn.to/3jGEeiF)

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0099590085/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=0099590085&linkCode=as2&tag=taruntk20-21&linkId=bb27e2243c598c5d4317f4fcc6659b24"><img border="0" src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=IN&ASIN=0099590085&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=taruntk20-21" ></a><img src="//ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=taruntk20-21&l=am2&o=31&a=0099590085" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This is a book about the history of mankind. Of how we evolved to be what we are right now. As a young kid I used to despise history, so much that I often flunked it. This book however changed my perspective about history and I wondered why not teach history to students in this way which seems full of wonder and awe. This book made me re consider about topics I would always hate and made me realize that there are always ways to learn something new.

## 2. [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://amzn.to/36vsT0Q)

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0141033576/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=0141033576&linkCode=as2&tag=taruntk20-21&linkId=ee920ed502c4bb44df3dfa8efb3cabe3"><img border="0" src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=IN&ASIN=0141033576&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=taruntk20-21" ></a><img src="//ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=taruntk20-21&l=am2&o=31&a=0141033576" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Thinking fast and slow is about the study of two psychologist which led them to a Nobel Prize in the field of Economics. Weird isn't it? Well not really. This book explains how our mind works when confronted with different economic options, it particularly talks about system 1 and system 2. How each of has a quick thinking mind, and a slow careful one. This book really blew my mind and made me rethink a lot about a lot of data that I might see in daily life and the bias it might have.

## 3. [The Intelligent Investor](https://amzn.to/36t0Tee)

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00V17D4YA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=B00V17D4YA&linkCode=as2&tag=taruntk20-21&linkId=55816d6e77c3ec0f89ed13682b320636"><img border="0" src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=IN&ASIN=B00V17D4YA&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=taruntk20-21" ></a><img src="//ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=taruntk20-21&l=am2&o=31&a=B00V17D4YA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Intelligent Investor is a good book to introduce you to the world of investing, though some might say that few of the techniques as analysis in this book is outdated for today's age, but I personally think that all the basics still hold and though I am not much of an investor anyway, I would say no one should invest without reading this book especially in the stock market. Another book of value that you might want to read related to this is Rich Dad Poor Dad.

## 4. [The Gene](https://amzn.to/3itkg9F)

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0143422162/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=0143422162&linkCode=as2&tag=taruntk20-21&linkId=b7d2e9d0b49f7a680b6a7c4ff7924ddc"><img border="0" src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=IN&ASIN=0143422162&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=taruntk20-21" ></a><img src="//ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=taruntk20-21&l=am2&o=31&a=0143422162" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Just like Sapiens helped me appreciate history as a subject, there was another subject I used to fear as a child and that was biology. That changed quickly as soon as I started reading this book. This is a book about the history of the gene and genetics, and believe me there is a lot going on there that you don't know and there is also the reasoning for why a lot of things are not happening. Another book by the same author is the Emperor of all Maladies, which is a biography of cancer and I am reading it currently, reads just as good.

## 5. [Steve Jobs](https://amzn.to/3nexdYe)

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/034914043X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=034914043X&linkCode=as2&tag=taruntk20-21&linkId=3aba454c81e44a65ff4bc80f9b6bccaf"><img border="0" src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=IN&ASIN=034914043X&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=taruntk20-21" ></a><img src="//ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=taruntk20-21&l=am2&o=31&a=034914043X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The last one is a biography, and I don't think I need to tell you much about this person. The book however tells you a lot that you might not know about Steve Jobs and I was surprised as hell to know these things. This book makes you appreciate the brilliant mind behind Apple and at the same time makes him an ordinary man which might make you bring out the inventor in yourself.
