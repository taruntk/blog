To understand the internet we need to understand a couple of terms first.
**Website**: A website is just a collection of files working together(HTML, CSS, JS etc.)

## Network

A network is a group of computers connected together.
eg: if my phone and computer is connected to my wifi it is a network

Now to connect to the internet we need an Internet service provider (ISP) like AT&T, Vodafone etc.
The group of networks connected to the ISP is called an Autonomous System.

## Internet

Now coming to Internet. Internet in the most simplest terms is a network of networks.
These systems, data centers etc. are connected all over the world via the internet backbone (lines of optical fibre) to form the Internet.

You can check the whole internet backbone network throughout the world on the below website

In short we have a notion of a cloud but all these are just machines connected with each other.
And to communicate with each other we use IP addresses and DNS lookup, which I will cover in the next part of this Post.
